Allows your customers to negate the carbon emissions from the shipping of their order.

== Description ==

Effectively, by including the offsetting option, customers can choose to negate the carbon dioxide that goes into the atmosphere from the process of shipping their order. At the checkout, customers will see an option to offset the shipment. By selecting this box, the amount of carbon is automatically calculated and the offset fee is added to their shipping cost – usually well under a $1.00.

The unique CO2counter technology allows the offset certificate to be automatically generated as a PDF and emailed to the customer if required. The fee is used to invest in projects that prevent or remove greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere.

The CO2counter makes it simple for environmentally aware merchants to offer a tangible environmental benefit within the cart for their customers. This is being used worldwide to align with the merchants own environmental polices and to satisfy the 'Green Shoppers’ requirement to buy from sustainably responsible retailers.

The Gaia Partnership have arrangements in place with Climate Friendly to purchase offsets in the Tasmanian Native Forest Protection Project. For details of the offsets please visit http://gaiapartnership.com/services/page7/carbon_offsets.html.
