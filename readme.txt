Allows your customers to negate the carbon emissions from the shipping of their order.

== Description ==

Effectively, by including the offsetting option, customers can choose to negate the carbon dioxide that goes into the atmosphere from the process of shipping their order. At the checkout, customers will see an option to offset the shipment. By selecting this box, the amount of carbon is automatically calculated and the offset fee is added to their shipping cost – usually well under a $1.00.

The unique CO2counter technology allows the offset certificate to be automatically generated as a PDF and emailed to the customer if required. The fee is used to invest in projects that prevent or remove greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere.

The CO2counter makes it simple for environmentally aware merchants to offer a tangible environmental benefit within the cart for their customers. This is being used worldwide to align with the merchants own environmental polices and to satisfy the 'Green Shoppers’ requirement to buy from sustainably responsible retailers.

At the checkout, customers will see an option to offset the shipment. By selecting this box, the amount of carbon is automatically calculated and the offset fee is added to their shipping cost – usually well under a AUD$1.00.

= What part of the transaction is the Carbon Offset applying to? =

The carbon measurement and offsetting is looking at the distribution or delivery of goods only. The CO2 from the actual product is not calculated. If you wish to include a factor for the product please contact <a href="mailto:chris@gaiapartnership.com">chris@gaiapartnership.com</a> to discuss.

= Where does the offset money go? =

= What standards are used to calculate the CO2? =

The CO2counter methodology is in line with ISO14040 and other appropriate international standards. Specifically the calculation of the emissions from freight use <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs">Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs UK</a> (Defra) GHG Conversion Factors. While this is UK based research the methodology is used around the world as a bases for calculation. This allow Gaia to calculate the carbon emissions in a consistent manner by using the following: The data available gives: A mode of transport A weight of the goods The distance travelled from pick up to destination

= What is the Freight methodology used in the CO2counter? =

The measurement is looking at the distribution or delivery of goods to a single point. An allowance is made by weight, mode of transport and distance giving the amount of CO2_e generated by the movement of the finished product.

= How do I know the calculations are correct? =

The CO2counter has been developed drawing on creditable independent research from around the world. The calculator is under constant review and is updated as verified data becomes available.
